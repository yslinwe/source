  // to the settings, ALL default controls are removed and you have to add them back in by defining those below.

  // For example, let's say you just simply wanted to add 'restart' to the control bar in addition to the default.
  // Once you specify *just* the 'restart' property below, ALL of the controls (progress bar, play, speed, etc) will be removed,
  // meaning that you MUST specify 'play', 'progress', 'speed' and the other default controls to see them again.
